As a note: Everything in the `./data` sub-directory is the result of processing
Factorio's machine-readable JSON API docs, as well as data from Wube Software's
[factorio-data repo](https://github.com/wube/factorio-data). I suspect this
means it is a jurisdictionally-dependent legal question as to whether its use
is limited to the licenses/terms of service that apply to said API docs and
repo, or whether my license applies, or whether or not it is even
copyrightable. YMMV.
